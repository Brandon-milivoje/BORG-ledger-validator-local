This tool converts raw bbds_ledger.py logs into readable tables. It identifies PROD vs. TEST environments, confirms CQA routing (Wire 778/Class 1), and validates critical fields like tickerValue and scalingFactor. It alerts you to missing data or Borg mismatches and supports multi-ticker jobs. Paste your log and verify instantly.
